FixStart
Create a function called fixStart. It should take a single argument, a string, and return a version where all occurrences of its first character have been replaced with *****, except for the first character itself. You can assume that the string is at least one character long. For example:
fixStart('babble'): ‘ba**le’
fixStart('turtle'): ‘tur*le’
