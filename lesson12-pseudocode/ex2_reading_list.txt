Reading list

//Requirements
Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read! Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and already read (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
 Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: “The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien”. Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. 
If you read it, log a string like ‘You already read “The Hobbit” by J.R.R. Tolkien’, and if not, log a string like ‘You still need to read “The Lord of the Rings” by J.R.R. Tolkien.’

//Assumptions
- there's a list of books called readingList that contains all the in-scope books.

// Create the array of books
CREATE allBooksArray (empty array)
FOR book in readingList
    bookObject = new object
    bookObject.title = book title (string)
    bookObject.author = author (string)
    bookObject.alreadyRead = empty bool
    IF I've already read the book
        bookObject.alreadyRead = True
    ELSE
        bookObject.alreadyRead = False
    APPEND bookObject to allBooksArray


// Loop through allBooksArray logging an output for each book
FOR book in allBooksArray
    displayName = '"bookObject.title" by bookObject.author' (str)
    IF alreadyRead = True
        outputText = 'You already read' + displayName (str)
    ELSE 
        outputText = 'You still need to read' + displayName
