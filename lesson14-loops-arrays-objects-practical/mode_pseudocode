Pseudocode to calculate mode values for an array
Should return an array of numbers which occur the most in the sample
[1, 2, 3, 2] would return [2]
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3] would return [1, 2]

function mode(numbers)

    take an array numbers

    create an object numberCounts
    for each number in numbers
        if number exists in numberCounts keys
            increment numberCounts.<key> by 1
        else    
            create numbercount.<key> and set its value to 1


    for each item in numberCounts
        push [key, count] to sortableArray

    sort sortableArray on the second element in each constituent array
    mode = item[0] for the first item in the sorted array
    results = [mode]
    for each item in sortableArray after the first:
        if item[1] == mode
            push item[0] to results
        else
            break out of the loop
    
    return results
