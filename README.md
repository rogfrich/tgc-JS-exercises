# tgc-JS-exercises
Javascript exercises from the Coder's Guild JAMstack bootcamp.

Note: to use these files, create a basic HTML page and load the js as follows:
```
<script src="ex1.js"></script>
```
Most of the exercises output to `console.log()` so use the Developer Tools console to see the output.
